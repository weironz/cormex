# Changelog

## 0.1.13 — 2026-11-01

### Capture and authentication

- Support both legacy and current OpenCode SQLite layouts. One agent's scan failure no longer aborts initialization for the others.
- Preserve Codex projects, original chat titles, and the origin of archived chats. Empty projects are omitted.
- Improve device authorization and persist Windows credentials across processes. Reuse valid authentication instead of requiring repeated login.
- Automate initialization and initial history capture.

### Chat archive

- Load project directories and chats through server-side pagination, with lazy loading when projects are expanded.
- Separate human inputs, final replies, and internal context/process records. Render Markdown and group preparation/process details.
- Replace overflowing agent tabs with a source selector, remove the pinned category, and add persistent reading-width settings.

### Automatic memory

- Keep two views: memories and conversation summaries. No human approval queue is required.
- Extract from complete QA turns, bounded context, and archived tool evidence. Automatically validate meaning, retain useful information, deduplicate it, and append updated versions.
- Preserve source evidence and explain applicability. Keep plans distinct from implemented capabilities, and avoid promoting unadopted advice or one-off task assignments to facts.
- Cache extraction separately from semantic validation, so validator retries do not repeat the first model call.
- Keep historical full extraction opt-in. Small-sample trials remain bounded and do not enable background extraction.

### Upgrade

- Includes additive migrations for project metadata, pagination counters, extraction settings, trial progress, and validation caches.
- Back up the database before upgrading. Existing source records and fact history are retained; invalidation is recorded through append-only events.
- Model credentials are encrypted using a persistent, deployment-owned master key. Do not copy development credentials or chat data into production.
